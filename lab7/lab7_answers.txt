1. How many errors have you found in the assembly code? List all of them.
There are 8 errors found in first pass.

When we translating *.asm to *.obj, there are 8 errors found by the assemblor.

line 14: illegal operands for missing opcode (.ORIG)
so it will also said that 
line 15: instruction appears before .ORIG

line 16: constant outside of allowed range, becasue the address PCoffset has only 9 bit and x3010 is 16 bit.

line 18: illegal operands for ADD, because there are two ',' between DR and SR1

line 29: constant outside of allowed range, becasue the address PCoffset has only 9 bit and x300F is 16 bit.

line 31: label OUTERLOOP has already appeared becasue the order of BR is wrong. The correct order of BR is BRzp.

line 34: constant outside of allowed range, becasue the address PCoffset has only 9 bit and x3011 is 16 bit.

line 43: no .END directive found.

2. Please describe the factorial algorithm in pseudo code.

int factorial(int x)
{
    for(i=X-1;i>0;i--)
    {
        sum=0;
        for(j=i;j>0;j--)
        {
            sum+=x;
        }
        result=sum;
    }
    return result;
}

As a result, we can calculate the result of x! .
