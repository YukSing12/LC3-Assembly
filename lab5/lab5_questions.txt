1. How many instructions are there in "lab5.bin"? And how many are operate instructions?
There are three instructions in "lab5.bin" and there are two operate instructions.


2. What do commands "continue" and "step" do in LC3 simulator?
"continue" is the command to run our program.
"step" is the command to execute one step (into subroutine/trap) which is different 
from "next" which execute one step (into subroutine/trap).

3. What is the total number of commands in "lc3sim"? 
There are sixteen commands in "lc3sim" and they are as follows,
file <file>           -- file load (also sets PC to start of file)

break ...             -- breakpoint management

continue              -- continue execution
finish                -- execute to end of current subroutine
next                  -- execute next instruction (full subroutine/trap)
step                  -- execute one step (into subroutine/trap)

list ...              -- list instructions at the PC, an address, a label
dump ...              -- dump memory at the PC, an address, a label
translate <addr>      -- show the value of a label and print the contents
printregs             -- print registers and current instruction

memory <addr> <val>   -- set the value held in a memory location
register <reg> <val>  -- set a register to a value

execute <file name>   -- execute a script file

reset                 -- reset LC-3 and reload last file

quit                  -- quit the simulator

help                  -- print this help
